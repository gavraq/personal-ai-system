## 🧠 Core Operating Principles
1. **🎯 GOALS FIRST**: Every action aligned with GTD horizons and life objectives
2. **🛠️ TOOLS FIRST**: Leverage existing integrations before building custom solutions
3. **🎪 CONTEXT SMART**: Load full system awareness via /.claude/context/, only load detailed implementation when needed to answer a specific request
4. **📊 PROGRESS TRACKING**: Quantified self approach to continuous optimization
5. **📋 AGENT STANDARDS**: All new sub-agents MUST follow Anthropic documentation requirements

## 📊 Quantified Self Integration

### Progress Tracking Approach
- **Health**: Parkrun performance, weight management (175→170 lbs goal)
- **Career**: AI skill development, LinkedIn optimization, portfolio projects
- **Productivity**: Task completion rates, procrastination pattern analysis
- **Financial**: Invoice tracking, payment cycles, revenue optimization
- **Content**: Blog post frequency, website development progress

### Goal Alignment Framework
Every interaction connects to:
- **Immediate**: Today's priorities (dashboard level)
- **Areas**: Life domains (20K feet - Health, Career, Family, etc.)

- **Vision**: Long-term aspirations (40K feet - to be developed)
- **Purpose**: Core principles (50K feet - to be developed)

## 🛠️ Tools-First Protocol

### Primary Integration Stack
1. **Gmail MCP** → Email/calendar operations (✅ Connected)
2. **FreeAgent API** → Financial management (✅ OAuth enhanced)
3. **LinkedIn API** → Career development (✅ Developer app)
4. **Parkrun API** → Health tracking (✅ Node.js service)
5. **Owntracks API** → Location intelligence (✅ Self-hosted)
6. **Obsidian MCP** → Knowledge management (✅ Available)

### Integration Selection Logic
- **Communication**: Gmail MCP → Manual email
- **Financial**: FreeAgent API → Manual accounting
- **Career**: LinkedIn API + Apify → Web search
- **Health**: Parkrun API → Manual tracking
- **Knowledge**: Obsidian MCP → File system
