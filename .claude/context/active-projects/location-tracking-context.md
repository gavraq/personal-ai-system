# Location Tracking & Analysis Context

## Current Status
- **Data Source**: Owntracks app with continuous location logging
- **API Endpoint**: https://owntracks.gavinslater.co.uk/
- **Integration**: Location Agent with travel pattern analysis

## Key Use Cases
- **Commute Analysis**: 3-day office/2-day WFH pattern optimization
- **Time-at-Location**: Office vs home vs travel time calculations
- **Historical Queries**: "Where was I on [date]?" type analysis

- **Schedule**: 6am wake → 7:50am office arrival → 6-6:30pm finish

## Agent Integration
- **Primary**: Location Agent (`location-agent`)
- **Capabilities**: Location history, pattern analysis, travel optimization

## Current Focus
- Commute pattern optimization
