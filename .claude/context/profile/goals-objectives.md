# Goals & Objectives - Telos-Enhanced GTD Horizons

## Telos Layer (Above Traditional GTD)

### Problems I'm Solving
- **P1: Surface-Level Thinking** - People don't go deep on fundamentals
- **P2: Business-Technology Divide** (Primary) - Gatekeepers prevent business people from building solutions; AI is dissolving these barriers
- **P3: AI Career Transition Gap** - Professionals lack practical implementation experience
- **P4: Productivity Paralysis** - Planning without producing output
- **P5: Strategic Myopia** - Operational tasks crowd out big-picture thinking

### Mission
> Help business professionals—especially in risk management—develop the deep technical understanding to build their own AI-powered solutions, enabling them to bridge detailed execution and strategic thinking without depending on gatekeepers.

**Primary Focus**: P2 (Business-Technology Divide)
**Secondary**: P5 (Strategic Myopia), P1 (Surface-Level Thinking)

### Narratives
- **N1: The Bridge-Builder** - 25 years between business and technology, helping risk professionals seize the AI moment
- **N2: The Deep Practitioner** - Learn by going deep; Risk Agents is my laboratory
- **N3: The Pattern I've Lived** - Struggle, depth, mastery, teaching (Arthur Andersen story)

### Challenges
| # | Challenge | Type |
|---|-----------|------|
| C1 | Procrastination Pattern - planning vs executing | Behavioral |
| C2 | Career Path Uncertainty - Risk Agents vs employment | Strategic |
| C3 | Financial Uncertainty - stable but market-vulnerable | External |
| C4 | Life Transition Complexity - family + US move | External |
| C5 | Priority Drift - swayed by shiny objects | Behavioral |
| C6 | Enjoyment of the Meta - building systems > output | Psychological |
| C7 | Expression Difficulty - Build > Write > Speak | Psychological |
| C8 | Perfectionism - high standards before sharing | Psychological |
| C9 | Fear of Judgment - concern about reception | Psychological |

**Key Insight**: Expression hierarchy is Build > Write > Speak. Content strategy should start with building, then extract writing.
