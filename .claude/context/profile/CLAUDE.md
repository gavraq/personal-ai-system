# Profile

This directory contains personal context and identity information - your memory system for the user.

## Purpose

The profile system stores persistent information about Gavin that enables personalized, context-aware responses. You are responsible for maintaining and updating this information as you learn more.

## Files

- `.claude/context/profile/personal-profile.md` - WHO I AM: Essential identity, professional background, values, personality traits, challenges, interests, lifestyle, and family context
- `.claude/context/profile/goals-objectives.md` - WHAT I WANT: Telos-enhanced GTD horizons, priorities, progress tracking, KPIs, and life objectives

## Two-File Model

**personal-profile.md** (Stable - rarely updated)
- Personal and family details
- Professional background and career highlights
- Core values and guiding principles
- Key challenges and psychological patterns
- Communication and learning style
- Interests, hobbies, weekly rhythm

**goals-objectives.md** (Dynamic - frequently updated)
- Telos layer (Problems, Mission, Narratives, Strategies, KPIs)
- GTD Horizons (50K → Runway)

## Usage Guidelines

**Always reference** profile context when:
- Making recommendations (align with values and preferences)
- Planning tasks (consider work style and challenges)
- Setting priorities (align with goals and horizons)

**Update profile** when you learn:
- New preferences or work patterns
