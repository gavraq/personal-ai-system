Dear Anthropic Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Enterprise Account Executive position for Financial Services. I am excited to leverage my financial services leadership experience and current hands-on AI implementation work to help financial institutions implement their AI transformation with Anthropic products.

Why am I a good fit for this role?

These are the four key areas I bring to the table:
- Practical hands-on knowledge of AI implementation use-cases in financial services
- Deep knowledge and understanding of financial markets and in particular working in leadership positions for the largest banks (Deutsche, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Nordea, ICBC Standard Bank)
- Experience in implementing large-scale change programmes at financial services organisations
- Understanding of both the seller as well as the buyer perspective of selling software services to large financial services organisations

**Practical hand-on experience**

I'm currently living the customer journey your clients will experience. As Head of Risk Infrastructure at ICBC Standard Bank, I am responsible for representing the Risk Management team on the bank's innovation lab, which has recently been focused in bringing a variety of AI initiatives into the bank. In particular evaluating:
- application of generative AI in the preparation of Credit Papers within the current Credit Risk Management workflow
- exception management pattern recognition in large datasets used in market data required for risk calculations
- developing AI use cases for a knowledge management platform for the Risk department with enhanced context engineering

I am also a prolific user of AI-assisted code generation in prototyping to assist in fast-tracking the banks change management processes.

In a personal capacity I have been working with Claude models developing both personal products (a personal consultant system with approximately 10 sub-agents leveraging a highly efficient context engineering system to manage and maintain a clean context window) as well as developing consulting products (a Risk Management Agent Consulting System).

This hands-on implementation experience gives me credibility that purely sales-focused candidates cannot match - I understand both the promise and the practical challenges of AI adoption in regulated financial environments.

**Deep financial services and technology knowledge and experience**

I have been working in leadership roles in large financial services institutions for 30+ years at the intersection between the business and technology teams. I understand the complexities of working in a highly regulated financial services context having been responsible for the infrastructure driving the risk management models used to calculate bank capital. These are the most regulatory scrutinised models and require a combination of deep business knowledge as well as technology understanding. This has positioned me uniquely to understand both the executive decision-making process and the technical implementation challenges that financial institutions face when adopting AI.

**Proven Track Record of Change Management at Scale**

I have significant experience in managing large scale change programmes. I believe AI is without a doubt going to be the largest change affecting all companies. For financial services however there are added complications brought about through the highly regulated nature and the need for explainability that creates unique challenges. I have had to navigate these challenges in numerous high-profile programmes for many of the largest banks, in particular:

- Barclays - during the 2008 financial crisis I was part of the leadership team responsible for the integration of the Lehman business into Barclays. This required the integration of 10,000 employees, 2 data centres and all systems over a period of months, all whilst experiencing the financial markets collapsing around us - I was responsible for integrating all the risk systems while managing the daily risk reporting, ensuring we knew our precise risk position to ensure the bank survived the global financial crisis.
- Nordea - I was the programme manager responsible for re-engineering Nordea's investment banking systems from front to back (front office trading systems through to finance and risk systems). This EUR125million project was the largest programme undertaken by the investment bank in their simplification initiative.
- Most recently at ICBC Standard Bank I was responsible for developing a greenfield build for an instrument and market data platform housing all the banks market data required for risk and finance calculations.

These experiences have taught me that successful technology adoption in financial services requires not just technical excellence, but also the ability to build consensus among diverse stakeholders, navigate complex procurement processes, and ensure regulatory compliance—all critical skills for enterprise AI sales.

**Understanding both the seller and the Financial Services Buyer perspective**

Having been both the seller as well as the buyer in numerous enterprise technology decisions, I understand the financial services procurement mindset. Key insights I bring:

- Regulatory risk assessment is critical. Safety and compliance aren't just features, they're fundamental requirements
- Cultural change management often determines success more than technical capabilities - a deep understanding of the concerns of the key buyers as well as the actual IT implementers and their respective concerns is essential. Stakeholder alignment requires understanding these diverse perspectives from risk, compliance, technology, and business teams
- Governance processes within large financial services organisations can be slow and bureaucratic - I have years of experience in taking initiatives through these processes from business case initiation, to pilot programmes into implementation and finally return on investment realisation.

In addition to this more general perspective, with my practical understanding, I recognise some of the specific challenges around AI adoption that financial institutions face:

- Risk Management Concerns: How do we ensure AI decisions are explainable and compliant with regulatory requirements?
- Integration Complexity: How do we implement AI within existing risk and compliance frameworks?
- Cultural Resistance: How do we move from "AI might be risky" to "AI is essential for competitiveness"?
- ROI Justification: How do we build business cases that satisfy both technology and business stakeholders?

These are exactly the challenges where Anthropic's reliable and interpretable AI systems provide competitive advantage - and where my experience in risk management, regulatory compliance, and AI implementation would be valuable.

**Conclusion**

I am not just another enterprise sales professional—I am a practitioner who understands AI implementation challenges from the inside. My combination of executive-level financial services credibility, current AI development experience, and proven track record of leading systems transformations makes me uniquely qualified to help financial institutions adopt AI safely and effectively.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to Anthropic's mission in the financial services sector.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Gavin Slater
