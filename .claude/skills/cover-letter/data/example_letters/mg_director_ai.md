Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Director of Enterprise & Corporate Functions AI position at M&G. With over 30 years of financial services experience, leadership of enterprise-wide infrastructure programmes, and hands-on AI implementation experience, I believe I offer a unique combination of strategic vision and practical execution that aligns perfectly with M&G's ambition to embed AI across the enterprise.

**Strategic AI Leadership with Financial Services DNA**

In my current role leading Risk Infrastructure for the Chief Risk Officer at ICBC Standard Bank, I have been developing and executing enterprise-wide strategies that mirror the responsibilities outlined in your position. I lead cross-functional teams spanning risk management and technology delivery while establishing governance frameworks that balance innovation with regulatory compliance. This experience has taught me that successful AI adoption requires more than technical capability - it demands the ability to translate complex technology into business value while building the organisational frameworks that enable responsible deployment.

What excites me about this role is the opportunity to apply this strategic approach specifically to AI transformation. Having led the cultural and digital transformation at Nordea that established the investment bank as the leading Nordic digital bank, I understand that enterprise AI adoption is fundamentally a change management challenge wrapped in a technology opportunity.

**Practical AI Implementation: From Strategy to Delivery**

While many AI leadership roles focus purely on strategy, I bring hands-on technical credibility that enables me to bridge the gap between executive vision and engineering reality. I have:

- Developed real applications using AI assisted coding: Built a Credit Risk Workflow application using Django with state machine architecture, demonstrating practical understanding of AI system design and deployment
- Implemented personal AI infrastructure: Created a portfolio of 10 specialized AI agents handling everything from financial operations to knowledge management, task management and providing real-world experience with LLM integration and automation
- Established data foundations: Led greenfield development of a data foundation and supporting applications across Front Office, Risk, Finance and Operations at Nordea including enterprise data governance frameworks - the essential foundation for effective AI deployment

This combination of strategic planning and technical execution means I can credibly evaluate AI use cases, challenge vendor claims, and work alongside technical teams while maintaining focus on ROI and business outcomes.

**Building Governance Frameworks That Enable Innovation**

Having spent my career in highly regulated financial services environments - from Arthur Andersen through Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, Nordea and now ICBC - I have deep experience establishing governance frameworks that enable innovation while managing risk. At ICBC, I currently lead the development of our Target Operating Model, which includes establishing risk taxonomy frameworks, governance structures, and validation processes across the enterprise. I am also responsible for evaluation and deployment of AI use-cases for Risk.

I recognise that AI governance is not about creating bureaucratic hurdles, but about building confidence among stakeholders that AI deployments are responsible, explainable, and aligned with regulatory requirements. This is particularly critical in financial services, where M&G's 170+ year reputation depends on maintaining trust while embracing innovation.

**Translating AI Potential into Business Value**

Perhaps my most relevant experience for this role is my track record of identifying strategic initiatives, building compelling business cases, and driving adoption across sometimes skeptical stakeholder groups. At Barclays Capital, I managed technology portfolios for 300+ person teams, requiring constant prioritisation based on business value and ROI. This experience taught me to ask the hard questions: What problem are we actually solving? What is the measurable impact? How do we prove value delivery?

This pragmatic approach to AI is exactly what M&G needs as you scale from early experimentation to enterprise-wide deployment. Not every process needs AI, but the right applications of LLMs and generative AI can drive transformational efficiency gains - and I have the business acumen to identify which is which.

**Why M&G and Why Now**

This role in particular plays to my strengths of deep domain knowledge in financial services with a leading Financial Services company such as M&G along with the opportunity to lead and be fully focused on enterprise AI strategy rather than this being a small part of a wider role. This allows me to further build on the practical AI implementations that I have developed over the past few years with a full-time focus.

**What I Would Bring from Day One**

If selected for this role, I would bring:

1. A 90-day assessment plan to identify high-value AI use cases across corporate functions, building on quick wins while establishing the governance and capability foundations for scaled deployment
2. Cross-functional credibility from financial services, risk management, technology delivery, and business operations - enabling me to work effectively with diverse stakeholder groups
3. Practical AI experience that allows me to evaluate technology options, challenge vendor claims, and guide technical teams without requiring extensive education
4. Change management expertise from leading cultural transformations at Nordea and technology implementations at Barclays - essential for driving adoption across the organisation
5. A commitment to education and building internal capability, recognising that sustainable AI transformation requires upskilling your existing teams, not just hiring external experts

**Closing Thoughts**

The Director of Enterprise & Corporate Functions AI role at M&G is not just about implementing technology - it is about positioning the institution to thrive in an AI-augmented future while maintaining the trust and values that have defined your success. I believe my unique combination of financial services leadership, governance expertise, strategic planning capability, and hands-on AI implementation experience makes me an ideal candidate to lead this transformation.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with M&G's AI ambitions. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at gavin@slaters.uk.com.

Sincerely,

Gavin Slater
