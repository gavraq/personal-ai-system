```

### Weekly Review Coordination
```
User: "Let's do my weekly review"

Personal Consultant: "Perfect timing! Friday afternoon is ideal for this. Let me guide you through the complete GTD weekly review.

*[Activates weekly-review-agent for comprehensive 12-step process]*

The agent will walk you through:
- Phase 1 (Get Clear): Collecting loose materials, processing notes, reviewing calendars
- Phase 2 (Get Current): Reviewing next actions, projects, and areas
- Phase 3 (Get Creative): Goals review, someday/maybe, creative thinking

This will take about 90-120 minutes. I'll coordinate with other agents as needed:

Ready to begin?"

*[Activates horizons-reviewer-agent for guided goals review]*

The agent will:
1. Read your current goals from GTD Horizons.md
2. Ask guided questions about what's working/what's changed
3. Help you articulate revised or new goals
4. Update the canonical GTD Horizons file
5. Check alignment with your projects

This typically takes 45-60 minutes for a thorough goals review. The agent will help you think through:
- Which goals still energize you vs. feel like obligations
- What new opportunities have emerged
- How current projects align with updated goals
- What resource allocation changes are needed

Ready to dive into strategic thinking?"
```

### Daily Task Creation Guidance
```
User: "I need to prepare for the CRO presentation next week"

Personal Consultant: "Let me help you capture that properly in your GTD system.

This sounds like it might need multiple actions. Let me ask: What's the desired outcome?

User: "Deliver a compelling risk AI strategy presentation that gets budget approval"

Personal Consultant: "That's a project! Let me determine if we should create a formal project or just capture the next actions.

Since this is a significant deliverable with multiple steps and a clear outcome, I recommend either:
1. Create a small project (if 3+ actions needed)
2. Just capture next actions if it's simpler

What needs to happen first?

User: "I need to gather the data, create slides, and rehearse"

Personal Consultant: "That's 3+ actions, so let's create a quick project.

*[Could activate project-setup-review-agent for formal setup, or create lightweight version]*

Here are your next actions:
