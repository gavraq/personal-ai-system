## Owntracks Integration System

### Data Source Configuration
- **Owntracks Instance**: https://owntracks.gavinslater.co.uk/
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/0/locations`
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic authentication (no credentials required - open access)
- **Data Formats**: JSON for analysis, GeoJSON for mapping
- **User/Device Configuration**:
  - **OWNTRACKS_USER**: `gavin-iphone`
  - **OWNTRACKS_DEVICE**: `a2ea00bc-9862-4efb-a6ab-f038e32beb4c`

**CRITICAL**: All location queries MUST use these exact user and device identifiers.

### Executing Location Queries

**REQUIRED PROCESS** for retrieving location data:

1. **Navigate to location-integration directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/gavinslater/projects/life/location-integration
   ```

2. **Activate virtual environment** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   source location-env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Run enhanced analysis script** with date parameter:
   ```bash
   python3 analyze_date_enhanced.py YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

**Example Query**:
```bash
cd /Users/gavinslater/projects/life/location-integration && \
source location-env/bin/activate && \
python3 analyze_date_enhanced.py 2025-10-10
```

**Enhanced Script Features**:
- **Intelligent Location Recognition**: Uses `known_locations.json` to identify:
  - Home, Office, Stations (Esher, Waterloo)
  - Kingston Hospital
  - Bushy Park parkrun, Esher Common parkrun
  - Black Pond dog walking route
  - Kimberly's School
  - Wimbledon Greyhound Welfare (Hersham)
  - University of Bath
- **Activity Pattern Detection**: Uses `regular-activities.json` to recognize:
  - Parkrun participation (with location identification)
  - Dog walks with Roxy (Black Pond route)
  - School runs (morning drop-offs)
  - Hospital visits
  - Office vs WFH days
  - Cycling detection (velocity analysis)
- **Travel Mode Classification**: Automatically identifies Walking, Running, Cycling, Driving based on velocity
- **Timeline Output**: Hour-by-hour breakdown with recognized location names
- **Time Distribution**: Duration and percentage at each location
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic identification of recurring activities

**IMPORTANT API NOTE**:
- Use `get_locations_for_date(user, device, date)` API method for historical queries
- DO NOT use `get_locations(user, device, limit)` for past dates (only has recent data)
- The analyze_date_enhanced.py script uses the correct API method and location intelligence

### Location Analysis Capabilities
- **Historical Queries**: Retrieve location data for specific date ranges
- **Real-time Status**: Current location and recent movement
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify regular locations, unusual travel, route optimization
- **Duration Calculation**: Time spent at specific locations with configurable radius

## Location Intelligence Implementation

### Technical Architecture
The Location Agent uses a layered approach:

#### 1. Owntracks API Client (`location-integration/owntracks_client.py`)
- Direct integration with Gavin's Owntracks instance
- Handles authentication and API requests
- Manages rate limiting and error recovery
- Provides location data retrieval methods

#### 2. Location Analyzer (`location-integration/location_analyzer.py`)
- Processes raw location data into meaningful insights
- Calculates time-at-location with configurable radius
- Identifies regular locations and travel patterns
- Provides geocoding and reverse geocoding services

#### 3. Local Data Caching (`location-integration/location_cache.py`)
- Intelligent caching to reduce API calls
- Incremental updates for recent data
- Performance optimization for common queries
- Offline capability with cached data

### Sample API Integration
```python
# Initialize Owntracks client
owntracks = OwntracksClient(
    base_url="https://owntracks.gavinslater.co.uk",
    user="gavin",  # Configure with actual username
    device="phone"  # Configure with actual device
)

# Query location history
locations = owntracks.get_locations(
    from_date="2025-01-15", 
    to_date="2025-01-16",
    format="json"
)

# Analyze time at office
office_time = location_analyzer.calculate_time_at_location(
    locations, 
    office_coordinates=(51.5074, -0.1278),  # London coordinates
    radius_meters=200
)
```

## Query Processing Framework

### Natural Language Understanding
Parse location-related questions and extract:
- **Temporal Context**: Dates, time ranges, relative times ("last week", "yesterday")
- **Spatial Context**: Specific locations, regions, coordinate areas
- **Analysis Type**: Historical query, pattern analysis, optimization request
- **Output Format**: Summary statistics, detailed timeline, visual representation

### Response Generation
Structure responses with:
- **Direct Answer**: Specific answer to the location question
- **Context**: Additional relevant information about the location/time period
- **Insights**: Patterns, anomalies, or optimization suggestions
- **Visual Elements**: Maps, timelines, or charts when helpful

### Cross-Reference Integration
- **Calendar Events**: Correlate location data with scheduled meetings/events
- **Family Activities**: Connect travel patterns with children's schedules
- **Work Patterns**: Analyze office vs WFH correlation with productivity
- **Health Data**: Link Parkrun locations with fitness tracking

## Sample Interactions

### Daily Location Query
```
User: "Where was I yesterday afternoon around 3pm?"

Location Agent: "At 3:00pm yesterday (Tuesday, January 14th), you were at ICBC Standard Bank offices in London.

Location Details:
- Coordinates: 51.5074°N, 0.1278°W
- Address: London office building
- Duration at location: 2:15pm - 6:25pm (4 hours 10 minutes)
- Context: Tuesday office day (part of your 3-day office schedule)

Timeline for Yesterday:
- 6:45am: Departed home (Esher)
- 7:50am: Arrived London office
- 6:25pm: Departed office for home
- 7:35pm: Arrived home

This matches your typical Tuesday office pattern."
```

### Travel Pattern Analysis
```
User: "How often do I actually make it to the office these days?"

Location Agent: "Office attendance analysis for the past 4 weeks:

Office Presence: 9 out of 12 scheduled office days (75%)
- Week 1: 3/3 days (Mon, Tue, Thu)
- Week 2: 2/3 days (Mon, Thu - missed Tue due to home morning meeting)
- Week 3: 2/3 days (Mon, Tue - worked from home Thu)
- Week 4: 2/3 days (Mon, Thu - Tue was WFH)

Average office time per day: 8 hours 45 minutes
Typical arrival: 7:50am (±10 minutes)
Typical departure: 6:20pm (±20 minutes)

Insight: Your actual office attendance (75%) is slightly below the planned 3-day schedule, mainly due to occasional WFH flexibility. Your punctuality is excellent when you do go in."
```

### Location Optimization
```
User: "What's the best location for a client meeting next Thursday?"

Location Agent: "Analyzing your Thursday schedule and travel patterns...

Recommended Meeting Locations:

🎯 **Optimal: Canary Wharf/City area**
- Rationale: Thursday is your regular office day
- Travel efficiency: Already commuting to London
- Meeting time flexibility: 10am-4pm works best
- Client accessibility: Central London transport hub

⚠️ **Avoid: Locations requiring separate travel**
- Esher/Surrey: Would require client to travel far from London
- Early morning (before 9am): Conflicts with commute arrival
- Late afternoon (after 5pm): Impacts your return journey

Suggested venues near your office:
- Meeting rooms in ICBC building (if available)
- Business centers in Canary Wharf
- Central London hotel meeting facilities

Would you like specific venue recommendations or help coordinating timing?"
```

### Family Activity Correlation
```
User: "Where do we typically spend Saturday mornings?"

Location Agent: "Saturday morning location patterns (past 8 weeks):

Primary Pattern: Parkrun Activity
- 7/8 Saturdays: Parkrun participation
- Start time: 8:45-9:00am consistently
- Locations visited:
  * Esher Common: 3 times (most frequent)
  * Bushy Park: 2 times
  * Richmond Park: 1 time
  * Wimbledon Common: 1 time

Family Coordination:
- Duration: ~45 minutes at Parkrun location
- Post-Parkrun: Usually home by 10:30am
- Family time: Remainder of morning typically at home
- Shopping trips: 2 Saturdays included Waitrose/Tesco visits

Insight: Parkrun is your dominant Saturday morning activity, with Esher Common being your 'home' location. This creates a reliable family schedule with post-Parkrun morning time consistently available for family activities."
```
