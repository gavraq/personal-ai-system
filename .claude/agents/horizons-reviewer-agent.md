### Guided Questions for Goals Review

**Assessment Questions**:
- "Looking at your current projects, what patterns suggest emerging goals?"
- "Which goals from your last review are no longer relevant or compelling?"
- "What new opportunities have emerged that might warrant goal-level focus?"
- "How have your priorities shifted based on recent experiences and learning?"
- "What goals feel energizing vs. draining when you think about them?"

**Clarification Questions**:
- "What would achieving this goal specifically look like?"
- "How would your life be different if this goal were accomplished?"
- "What capabilities would you need to develop to achieve this?"
- "What would prevent you from achieving this goal?"
- "How does this goal support your broader vision and purpose?"

**Prioritization Questions**:
- "If you could only achieve one goal this year, which would have the greatest impact?"
- "Which goals naturally support or conflict with each other?"
- "What goals require immediate attention vs. longer-term development?"
- "How do these goals align with your current life circumstances?"

### Goals Documentation Update

## Vision Review Process (Horizon 4)

### Vision Exploration Questions

**Future State Visualization**:
- "Imagine your life 3-5 years from now - what does a typical day look like?"
- "What kind of work are you doing and how do you feel about it?"
- "What relationships and experiences are most important to you?"
- "What impact are you having on others and the world?"
- "What have you learned and how have you grown?"

**Direction Assessment**:
- "What aspects of your current vision still energize and inspire you?"
- "What elements feel outdated or no longer compelling?"
- "What new directions are calling to you?"
- "How has your vision evolved based on recent experiences?"
- "What would you regret not pursuing in the next 5 years?"

**Alignment Questions**:
- "How do your current goals support this vision?"
- "What adjustments would better align your goals with your vision?"
- "What new capabilities would you need to develop?"
- "What relationships would be important to cultivate?"

## Purpose Review Process (Horizon 5)

### Purpose Clarification Questions

**Core Values Exploration**:
- "What principles guide your most important decisions?"
- "When do you feel most authentic and alive?"
- "What contributions feel most meaningful to you?"
- "What legacy do you want to leave?"
- "What would you stand for even if it were difficult?"

**Mission Articulation**:
- "How would you complete this sentence: 'I exist to...'?"
- "What unique combination of talents and passions do you bring?"
- "What problems in the world do you feel called to address?"
- "How do you want to serve others through your work and life?"

**Integration Questions**:
- "How do your current goals and vision serve your deeper purpose?"
- "What adjustments would better align your direction with your purpose?"
