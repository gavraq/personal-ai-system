## Email Sending Instructions

### Sending Emails via MCP
To send emails, use the Gmail MCP tools with this exact process:

**Step 1: Create Email Draft**
Use `create_gmail_draft` to create the email:
```python
# For new emails (not replies)
create_gmail_draft({
    "__user_id__": "gavin.n.slater@gmail.com",
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "subject": "Email Subject",
    "body": "Email body content",
    "cc": ["cc@example.com"]  # Optional
})
```

**Step 2: For Replies**
Use `reply_gmail_email` for responding to existing emails:
```python
reply_gmail_email({
    "__user_id__": "gavin.n.slater@gmail.com",
    "original_message_id": "email_id_to_reply_to",
    "reply_body": "Your reply content",
    "send": True,  # Set to True to send immediately, False for draft
    "cc": ["cc@example.com"]  # Optional for "reply all"
})
```

### Standard Method for Claude Code
Use Bash to call the MCP server directly (this is the working method for Claude Code):

```bash
# Create a Python script to send email via MCP
python3 -c "
import subprocess
import json
import time

def send_email_via_mcp(to, subject, body):
    cmd = ['uvx', 'mcp-gsuite', '--gauth-file', './.gauth.json', '--oauth2-dir', './', '--credentials-dir', './', '--accounts-file', '../.accounts.json']

    process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True, bufsize=1, cwd='/Users/gavinslater/mcp-gsuite-test/credentials')

    # Initialize
    init_req = json.dumps({'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'id': 1, 'method': 'initialize', 'params': {'protocolVersion': '2024-11-05', 'capabilities': {'roots': {'listChanged': True}}, 'clientInfo': {'name': 'email-agent', 'version': '1.0.0'}}}) + '\n'
    process.stdin.write(init_req)
    process.stdin.flush()
    process.stdout.readline()

    # Send initialized
    init_notif = json.dumps({'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'method': 'notifications/initialized'}) + '\n'
    process.stdin.write(init_notif)
    process.stdin.flush()

    # Create email
    email_req = json.dumps({'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'id': 2, 'method': 'tools/call', 'params': {'name': 'create_gmail_draft', 'arguments': {'__user_id__': 'gavin.n.slater@gmail.com', 'to': to, 'subject': subject, 'body': body}}}) + '\n'
    process.stdin.write(email_req)
    process.stdin.flush()
    response = process.stdout.readline()

    process.terminate()
    return json.loads(response)

# Usage
result = send_email_via_mcp('gavin@slaters.uk.com', 'test message', 'this is a test of the email agent')
print('Email created:', result)
"
```

### Calendar Operations
```python
# Calendar management examples
calendar_events = mcp_calendar_list_events(
    start_date="2025-08-10",
    end_date="2025-08-16"
)

# Optimize schedule
office_days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Thursday"]  # Gavin's pattern
optimized_schedule = optimize_calendar_for_commute(calendar_events, office_days)

# Block focus time
focus_blocks = mcp_calendar_create_focus_blocks(
    preferred_times=["09:00-11:00", "14:00-16:00"],
    exclude_days=office_days  # More flexibility on WFH days
)
```
