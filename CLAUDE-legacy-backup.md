# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is Gavin's personal Life project repository, now architected as a comprehensive **Personal Consultant System** with specialized sub-agents that manage all aspects of his life coordination.

### Personal Consultant Architecture

The system operates through a master **Personal Consultant** that orchestrates **8 specialized sub-agents**:

1. **Personal Consultant** (`personal-consultant`) - Master orchestrator and strategic life coordinator
2. **Daily Brief Agent** (`daily-brief-agent`) - AI-powered news curation and current events analysis  
3. **FreeAgent Invoice Agent** (`freeagent-invoice-agent`) - Financial management and invoice operations
4. **Job Search Agent** (`job-search-agent`) - AI career transition specialist and opportunity identification
5. **Email Management Agent** (`email-management-agent`) - âœ… Email and calendar management using Gmail MCP server integration (Connected)
6. **Interactive CV Website Agent** (`interactive-cv-website-agent`) - Modern web development for portfolio website creation
7. **Knowledge Manager Agent** (`knowledge-manager-agent`) - Obsidian vault integration for personal knowledge management
8. **Location Agent** (`location-agent`) - Owntracks geolocation data analysis and travel pattern insights
9. **Health Agent** (`health-agent`) - Health and fitness data integration with quantified self analytics

### Legacy Python Systems (Now Sub-Agent Integrated)

1. **Daily Brief System** - AI-powered news curation that analyzes personal files for interests and delivers relevant news
2. **FreeAgent Sub-Agent** - Natural language interface for FreeAgent invoice management API

- `SimpleDailyBrief` - Main orchestration system with web tool integration

**Data Flow**:
1. Analyze personal files for interests (technology, business, locations)
2. Generate search terms from interest analysis 
3. Search web for recent news articles
4. Score articles for relevance (0.0-1.0)
5. Generate actionable suggestions for each relevant article
6. Format as comprehensive daily brief markdown

#### Email Management Agent Architecture

**Gmail MCP Integration**: âœ… **Connected and Operational**

## File Analysis Paths

### Interest Analysis (Daily Brief)
```python
default_paths = [
    "/Users/gavinslater/projects/life",      # This repository
    "/Users/gavinslater/Desktop",            # Current work files  
    "/Users/gavinslater/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/GavinsiCloudVault",  # Obsidian notes
    "/Users/gavinslater/.config"             # Configuration files
]
```

### Key Interest Categories Detected
- **Technology**: python (238 mentions), api (222), docker (220), ai (143)
- **Business**: risk management, finance, consulting, audit  
- **Companies**: ICBC, Standard Bank, FreeAgent
- **Locations**: London, Surrey, New York

## Performance Characteristics

### Daily Brief Generation
- **Analysis Phase**: 30-60 seconds (processes 200+ files, 1M+ characters)
- **Curation Phase**: 2-4 minutes (10-12 web searches, 20-30 articles processed)  
- **Total Time**: 3-5 minutes for complete personalized brief
- **Output**: 10-15 relevant articles with 0.3+ relevance scores

### FreeAgent Operations  
- **Invoice Listing**: 1-2 seconds (with pagination)
- **Invoice Creation**: 2-3 seconds per invoice
- **OAuth Refresh**: Automatic, transparent to user
- **Rate Limiting**: 60 requests/minute with exponential backoff

## Testing Strategy

### Daily Brief System
- **No formal test suite** - uses demo system for validation
- **Demo Testing**: `python3 daily-brief-system/demo_daily_brief.py`
- **Integration Testing**: Run `/daily-brief` command in Claude Code
- **Validation**: Check generated briefs in daily-brief-*.md files

### FreeAgent Sub-Agent  
- **No formal test suite** - uses sandbox environment
- **Manual Testing**: CLI commands and natural language processing  
- **Production Validation**: Successfully created real invoices (ICBC 016-018)
- **OAuth Testing**: Token refresh cycles validated in production

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### Daily Brief Common Issues
- **"Web search tools not available"**: Must run in Claude Code environment, not standalone Python
- **"No relevant articles found"**: Lower `min_relevance` threshold or increase `max_articles`  
- **"Could not analyze interests"**: Check file permissions in analysis paths

### FreeAgent Common Issues
- **Authentication errors**: Use OAuth Playground for token setup
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in exponential backoff handles automatically
- **Invoice creation failures**: Check contact mapping and required fields

## Security Considerations

### Daily Brief System
- **Local Processing**: All file analysis happens locally, no upload to external services
- **Web Search Only**: Only search queries sent over network, not file contents
- **No Persistence**: No permanent storage of personal information  
- **Privacy First**: Your personal files never leave the machine

### FreeAgent Sub-Agent
- **OAuth Security**: Production-grade OAuth 2.0 implementation
- **Credential Storage**: Secure config file with automatic token refresh
- **API Rate Limiting**: Respects FreeAgent API limits and guidelines
- **Production Ready**: Handles real financial data with appropriate security

## Development Environment

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.9+ (currently using 3.13)
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0) - paths may need adjustment for other platforms
- **Internet**: Required for news search and FreeAgent API calls
- **Claude Code**: Required for daily brief web tool integration

### IDE Integration
- **No specific IDE requirements** - standard Python development environment  
- **Virtual Environments**: Both systems include pre-configured venv directories
- **Dependencies**: Minimal - mostly standard library with requests, beautifulsoup4, feedparser

## Using the Personal Consultant System

### Primary Interface
The repository now operates through the **Personal Consultant sub-agent system**. To use:

1. **Activate Personal Consultant**: In Claude Code, the system should automatically recognize requests and delegate to the Personal Consultant
2. **Natural Language Requests**: Ask questions or give commands in natural language
3. **Multi-Domain Coordination**: The Personal Consultant will coordinate multiple sub-agents as needed
4. **Strategic Guidance**: Receive integrated insights aligned with Gavin's long-term goals

### Example Usage Patterns
- **"Good morning, what should I focus on today?"** â†’ Personal Consultant coordinates daily brief, financial status, and strategic priorities
- **"Any new AI job opportunities on LinkedIn?"** â†’ Job Search Agent searches LinkedIn with profile matching
- **"How ready is my LinkedIn profile for AI roles?"** â†’ Job Search Agent analyzes profile and provides optimization plan
- **"What's my financial situation?"** â†’ FreeAgent Invoice Agent provides comprehensive status
- **"What's happening in my field?"** â†’ Daily Brief Agent curates relevant news and insights
- **"Analyze this LinkedIn job posting for me"** â†’ Job Search Agent provides match score and application strategy
- **"Update my portfolio website with this new project"** â†’ Interactive CV Website Agent creates project showcase and deploys updates
- **"Where did I spend most time last week?"** â†’ Location Agent analyzes Owntracks data for time-at-location insights
- **"Create today's daily note"** â†’ Knowledge Manager Agent generates standardized daily note in Obsidian vault
- **"Save this research for later"** â†’ Knowledge Manager Agent organizes information with proper tags and cross-references
- **"What urgent emails do I have?"** â†’ Email Management Agent processes Gmail and prioritizes responses
- **"Optimize my commute based on recent patterns"** â†’ Location Agent provides travel optimization suggestions
- **"How's my fitness going this year?"** â†’ Health Agent provides comprehensive 2025 parkrun statistics (31 runs confirmed)
