## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Output Format Variety
**Issue**: Different skills need different output formats
**Solution**: Used output_format field to specify JSON, Markdown, CSV, or Mixed

### Challenge 2: Example Size
**Issue**: Some examples (charter, status report) are very long
**Solution**: Included full examples in SKILL.md to show exactly what's expected

### Challenge 3: Complexity Balance
**Issue**: Making skills powerful but not overwhelming
**Solution**: Used optional parameters and "Tips for Best Results" sections

---

## Next Steps

With 5 core skills complete, we moved to:
- **Step 6.3**: Implement 4 advanced Change Agent skills
- Remaining skills: decision-log, risk-register, requirements-gathering, communication-plan

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Template Effectiveness**: SKILL_TEMPLATE.md reduced creation time significantly
2. **Examples First**: Writing examples helped clarify output structure
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Starting simple (RACI) then complex (status report) worked well
4. **Realistic Content**: Using real project management scenarios made skills immediately useful

### What Could Be Improved
- Could have created shared resource files for common patterns
- Could have standardized JSON schema across skills
- Could have created more cross-skill integration examples

### Process Improvements
- Template usage cut development time from ~60 min to ~35 min average
- Having validation patterns upfront prevented rework
- Clear success criteria kept scope in check
