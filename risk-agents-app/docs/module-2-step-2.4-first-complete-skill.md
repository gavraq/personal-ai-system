# Module 2, Step 2.4: First Complete Skill

**Completed**: October 22, 2025

## What We Built

In this step, we created the first complete skill for the Skills Framework: **meeting-minutes-capture**. This demonstrates the full Skills Framework structure with all four layers of progressive disclosure, providing a complete example of how skills should be organized.

## Why This Matters

Creating a complete skill accomplishes several goals:
- **Validates the Skills Framework**: Proves the structure works for real use cases
- **Provides a template**: Future skills can follow this pattern
- **Demonstrates progressive disclosure**: Shows how the four layers work in practice
- **Tests the SkillsLoader**: Ensures our loader can handle real skill data
- **Enables real functionality**: Users can actually capture meeting minutes!

## Directory Structure

**Location**: `backend/.claude/skills/change-agent/meeting-minutes-capture/`

```
meeting-minutes-capture/
├── SKILL.md (metadata + description)
├── instructions/
│   ├── capture.md
│   └── extract-actions.md
└── resources/
    ├── meeting-template.md
    └── examples.md
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. What is a Complete Skill?

A **complete skill** includes all four layers of the Skills Framework:

**Layer 1: Metadata** (YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md)
- Quick facts about the skill
- What it does and when to use it
- Parameters and output format
- ~200 bytes

**Layer 2: Instructions** (instructions/*.md files)
- Step-by-step execution guidance
- How to handle different scenarios
- Quality checks and best practices
- ~2-5 KB per file

**Layer 3: Resources** (resources/*.md files)
- Templates for output formatting
- Examples of transformations
- Reference data
- ~1-3 KB per file

**Layer 4: Code** (code/*.py files - future)
- Python utilities for complex operations
- Parsers, validators, formatters
- Optional - not all skills need code

### 2. YAML Frontmatter Structure

**YAML frontmatter** is metadata between `---` markers at the top of SKILL.md:

```yaml
---
name: meeting-minutes-capture
description: Capture meeting minutes from transcripts or notes and extract structured action items, decisions, and next steps
domain: change-agent
category: meeting-management
taxonomy: change-agent/meeting-management
parameters:
  - meeting_transcript
  - meeting_date
  - attendees
output_format: structured_markdown
estimated_duration: 2-3 minutes
---
```

**Required fields** (Claude standard):
- `name`: Skill identifier (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)
- `description`: What the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)

**Enhanced fields** (our additions):
- `domain`: Organizational domain (e.g., "change-agent")
- `category`: Skill category (e.g., "meeting-management")
- `taxonomy`: Full hierarchical path
- `parameters`: Expected input parameters
- `output_format`: Expected output format
- `estimated_duration`: How long execution takes

### 3. Skill Categories

Skills are organized hierarchically:

```
Domain: change-agent
└── Categories:
    ├── meeting-management (meeting-minutes-capture, action-tracking)
    ├── project-artifacts (charter-generator, plan-template)
    ├── requirements-gathering (business-requirements, use-cases)
    └── status-tracking (status-reports, milestone-tracker)
```

**Why categorization matters**:
- Easy browsing and discovery
- Filters in API endpoints
- Logical organization at scale (100+ skills)
- Clear responsibility boundaries

### 4. Multiple Instruction Files

Skills can have **multiple instruction files** for different aspects:

**Example: meeting-minutes-capture**
- `capture.md`: How to capture minutes from various formats
- `extract-actions.md`: How to identify and extract action items

**Benefits**:
- Separation of concerns
- Load only what's needed
- Clear, focused guidance
- Easier to maintain

**Alternative approaches**:
- Single large instruction file (harder to navigate)
- Inline instructions in SKILL.md (limited progressive disclosure)

### 5. Resource Files

**Resources** provide templates, examples, and reference data:

**Templates** (`meeting-template.md`):
- Standard output format
- Placeholders for data
- Formatting conventions
- Usage guidelines

**Examples** (`examples.md`):
- Real-world transformations
- Input → Output demonstrations
- Edge cases handled
- Quality benchmarks

**Why separate from instructions**:
- Progressive disclosure (load only when needed)
- Reusable across skills
- Large files don't slow down initial loading
- Can be updated independently

### 6. Markdown Format

**Why markdown for skill content?**

**Advantages**:
- Human-readable and editable
- Rich formatting (headers, lists, code blocks)
- Universal support (GitHub, editors, browsers)
- Claude can parse and generate markdown
- Version control friendly (git diff works well)

**Example markdown features used**:
```markdown
# Headers for organization
## Subheadings for sections

- Bullet lists for steps
- Numbered lists for sequences

**Bold** for emphasis
*Italic* for terms

`Code blocks` for examples
```

### instructions/extract-actions.md (Layer 2 - Specific Guidance)

**Purpose**: Focused instructions for identifying and extracting action items

**File**: `backend/.claude/skills/change-agent/meeting-minutes-capture/instructions/extract-actions.md`

**Content** (~1,600 words):

**1. What is an Action Item?**:
```markdown
An action item is a task that:
✓ Has a clear deliverable or outcome
✓ Can be assigned to a person or team
✓ Has a completion criterion
✓ Can be tracked and verified

Not action items:
✗ General discussions or observations
✗ Information shared without follow-up
✗ Background context
```

**2. Identifying Explicit Action Items**:
- Phrases like "will", "should", "needs to"
- Commitments: "I'll take care of..."
- Assignments: "Alice, can you..."
- Deadlines: "by Friday", "before next meeting"

**3. Identifying Implicit Action Items**:
- Problems mentioned without solutions (likely need follow-up)
- Questions without answers (need research)
- "Let's discuss this later" (schedule follow-up)
- Decisions requiring implementation (someone needs to do it)

**4. Extraction Process** (5 detailed steps):
```markdown
### Step 1: Scan for Action Verbs
Look for: prepare, create, review, send, schedule, research, implement, etc.

### Step 2: Identify the Owner
Who will do it?
- Explicit: "Alice will prepare..."
- Implicit: "We need someone to..." (clarify ownership)

### Step 3: Determine the Deliverable
What will be produced?
- Tangible: document, report, presentation
- Intangible: decision, approval, information

### Step 4: Extract the Timeline
When is it due?
- Absolute: "by October 30"
- Relative: "by next meeting"
- Ongoing: "every Monday"

### Step 5: Note Dependencies
What blocks this action?
- Prerequisites: "after budget approval"
- Information needed: "once we have data"
- People dependencies: "waiting for Sarah"
```

**5. Action Item Template**:
```markdown
- **Task**: [Clear, actionable description]
  - **Owner**: [Person responsible]
  - **Due Date**: [Specific date or relative timeframe]
  - **Status**: [Not Started / In Progress / Completed / Blocked]
  - **Dependencies**: [What this depends on, if anything]
  - **Notes**: [Additional context]
```

**6. Examples of Good vs Poor Action Items**:
```markdown
❌ Poor: "Think about Q4 planning"
✅ Good: "Alice will create Q4 project charter document by Oct 30"

❌ Poor: "Follow up on budget"
✅ Good: "Bob will request budget approval from Finance by Oct 25"

❌ Poor: "Someone should review requirements"
✅ Good: "Charlie will review requirements document and provide feedback by Oct 28"
```

**7. Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Each action has a clear deliverable?
- [ ] Owner is named (not "someone" or "team")?
- [ ] Due date is specific?
- [ ] Task is actionable (starts with verb)?
- [ ] Dependencies noted if applicable?

### resources/meeting-template.md (Layer 3 - Template)

**Purpose**: Standard format for meeting minutes output

**File**: `backend/.claude/skills/change-agent/meeting-minutes-capture/resources/meeting-template.md`

## Parking Lot

Items that need follow-up but weren't resolved in this meeting:
- [Issue 1]: [Brief description and next steps]
- [Issue 2]: [Brief description and next steps]

## Next Steps

1. [Immediate next action]
2. [Follow-up meeting scheduled]
3. [Information to be gathered]

## Next Meeting

**Date**: [Date]
**Time**: [Time]
**Purpose**: [What we'll discuss]
**Pre-reads**: [Materials to review before meeting]

---
**Minutes Prepared By**: [Name or AI]
**Date Distributed**: [Date]
**Recipients**: [List or "All attendees"]
```

**Usage Guidelines**:
1. **Customize sections**: Not all meetings need all sections
2. **Maintain consistency**: Use same template across organization
3. **Be concise**: Minutes should be scannable
4. **Focus on outcomes**: More decisions and actions, less discussion detail
5. **Distribute promptly**: Send within 24 hours while fresh

**Formatting Conventions**:
- Use markdown headers (# ## ###) for hierarchy
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms
- Use tables for action items (easy to scan)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use horizontal rule (---) to separate sections
