## Overview

The Knowledge Browser is a comprehensive interface for browsing, searching, and reading **Risk Taxonomy Framework artefacts**. It implements the digital manifestation of Gavin's Risk Taxonomy Framework - a structured classification scheme and nomenclature for risk management that provides complete coverage, consistency, and clear communication across all risk domains.

### Risk Taxonomy Framework Integration

The Knowledge Browser is built around the **11 Inventory Components** of the Risk Taxonomy Framework, transforming a generic document repository into a structured knowledge management system that demonstrates:

- **Complete coverage**: Comprehensive risk domain coverage through structured inventories
- **Consistency**: Consistent standards across different risk domains with clear intersection points
- **Communication**: Clear articulation of risk management practices to stakeholders, regulators, and auditors

### Key Features
- Browse all risk management artefacts organized by the 11 inventory components
- Filter by Risk Taxonomy Framework category (Policies, Governance, Processes, Controls, Products, Reports, Feeds, Data, Methodologies & Models, Systems, Risks)
- Search artefacts by title, summary, tags, or author
- Sort by recent, popular (views), or title (A-Z)
- View detailed artefact content in modal dialogs with cross-references
- Bookmark artefacts for quick access
- Track artefact views and read time
- Navigate related artefacts across taxonomy layers
- Real-time filter and search
- Color-coded visual system for instant taxonomy component identification

## Risk Taxonomy Framework - Detailed Integration

### Framework Background

The Risk Taxonomy Framework provides a structured classification scheme and nomenclature that ties together risk management and controls. The Knowledge Browser implements this framework as a digital knowledge management system.

**Purpose of the Risk Taxonomy Framework**:
- ðŸ”´ **Complete coverage**: Demonstrate comprehensive coverage across all risk domains
- ðŸ”´ **Consistency**: Apply consistent standards across different risk domains with clear intersection points
- ðŸ”´ **Communication**: Articulate risk management practices to new/existing staff, regulators, and auditors

**Core Concept**:
ðŸ”´ **Develop a Risk Taxonomy** - Classification scheme with nomenclature linking risk management and controls
ðŸ”´ **Link to artefacts** - Series of "inventories" providing evidence of completeness and consistency

### Framework Structure - The 11 Inventory Components

Each domain (Credit Risk, Market Risk, etc.) has artefacts across all 11 components:

#### Core Framework Layers

**1. Policies** (Blue)
- Policy documents covering risk appetite, governance structure, key controls, RCSA processes
- Regularly reviewed and updated (annual basis minimum)
- Example: Credit Risk Policy Framework

**2. Governance** (Purple)
- Official forums where Risk is represented or "owns"
- Mandate, Terms of Reference, memberships
- Example: Credit Risk Committee Terms of Reference

**3. Processes & Procedures** (Green)
- Business processes documented using Operational Risk process map templates
- Link to policies (process section) and controls (embedded in processes)
- Example: Credit Approval Process Map

**4. Controls** (Yellow)
- Inventory of all controls (key and non-key) from RCSA
- Key controls referenced in policy documents
- Example: Credit Limit Monitoring Controls Inventory

#### Operational Components

**5. Products** (Pink)
- Inventory of approved products for each business
- Product specifications ensuring appropriate risk management
- Example: Approved Products List - Interest Rate Derivatives

**6. Reports** (Cyan)
- Inventory of all reports with frequency, distribution, ownership
- BCBS239 compliance for risk data aggregation
- Example: Credit Risk Dashboard - Report Specification

**7. Feeds** (Orange)
- Data feed inventory with IDDs, SLAs, feed providers
- Interface Definition Documents (IDDs) specifying exact feed specifications
- Example: Trading System to CRMS Feed Interface

#### Technical Components

**8. Data** (Indigo)
- Data domains inventory (upstream input data + calculated output data)
- Data quality controls (timeliness, accuracy, completeness)
- Example: Credit Exposure Data Dictionary

**9. Methodologies & Models** (Violet)
- Model registry detailing all models in use
- Methodology documents linked to models
- Curve inventory (valuation curves + risk model curves)
- Example: CVA Methodology and Model Registry Entry

**10. Systems** (Teal)
- Systems used in risk processes (from process maps)
- High-level system flow charts
- Must include End User Computing (EUC) applications
- Example: Credit Risk Management System (CRMS) Configuration

#### Risk Classification

**11. Risks** (Red)
- Universe of risks and classification into types/sub-types
- Enables proper management of risks within the organization
- Example: Risk Taxonomy - Credit Risk Classification

### Cross-Referencing & Linkages

A key feature of the framework is the **linkages between artefacts across different components**:

**Example Linkage Flow - Credit Risk**:
```
Risk Taxonomy (Risks)
  â†“ defines scope for
Policy Framework (Policies)
  â†“ references
Governance Committee (Governance)
  â†“ oversees
Approval Process (Processes)
  â†“ embeds
Limit Monitoring Controls (Controls)
  â†“ implemented in
CRMS System (Systems)
  â†“ receives
Trading System Feed (Feeds)
  â†“ populates
Exposure Data (Data)
  â†“ uses
CVA Model (Methodologies & Models)
  â†“ calculates metrics for
Credit Dashboard (Reports)
  â†“ monitors
Approved Products (Products)
```

Each artefact includes `relatedArticles` linking to connected artefacts from other components.

### Framework Application - Change Management

The framework supports the change management process through "check-out / check-in":

**Change Process**:
1. **Check-Out**: Current production artefacts checked out during change projects
2. **Risk Change**: Artefacts updated during project implementation
3. **Check-In**: Updated artefacts checked in after validation and sign-off

**Example - New Product Onboarding**:
- Update: **Products** inventory (add new product)
- Update: **Policies** (if risk appetite impacts)
- Update: **Processes** (amended procedures)
- Add: **Data** metrics (new metrics for product)
- Update: **Feeds** (ensure new metrics fed into systems)
- Update: **Methodologies** (valuation and risk calculations)
- Update: **Systems** (configuration for new product)

---

## Mock Data - Credit Risk Domain Example

The Knowledge Browser demonstrates the framework using **11 comprehensive artefacts from the Credit Risk domain** - one for each inventory component. This showcases how a complete domain implementation would look.

### Artefact Distribution Across Components (11 Total)
1. **Policies** (1 artefact) - Credit Risk Policy Framework
2. **Governance** (1 artefact) - Credit Risk Committee ToR
3. **Processes & Procedures** (1 artefact) - Credit Approval Process Map
4. **Controls** (1 artefact) - Credit Limit Monitoring Controls
5. **Products** (1 artefact) - Approved Products List (IR Derivatives)
6. **Reports** (1 artefact) - Credit Risk Dashboard
7. **Feeds** (1 artefact) - Trading System to CRMS Feed
8. **Data** (1 artefact) - Credit Exposure Data Dictionary
9. **Methodologies & Models** (1 artefact) - CVA Methodology
10. **Systems** (1 artefact) - CRMS Configuration
11. **Risks** (1 artefact) - Credit Risk Classification

### Read Time Distribution

## Lessons Learned

1. **Risk Taxonomy Framework Integration**: Aligning the Knowledge Browser with the Risk Taxonomy Framework transforms it from a generic repository into a structured knowledge management system that demonstrates complete coverage, consistency, and clear communication
2. **11 Inventory Components**: Using the Risk Taxonomy Framework's 11 components (instead of generic categories) provides a professional, domain-specific classification scheme that maps to real-world risk management practices
3. **Content-Rich Mock Data**: Detailed Credit Risk artefacts with authentic terminology (IDD, SLA, RCSA, BCBS239, TEF, CRMS, CVA) demonstrate real-world usage and professional credibility
4. **Color-Coded Components**: 11 distinctive colors (blue, purple, green, yellow, pink, cyan, orange, indigo, violet, teal, red) improve visual scanning and instant component identification
5. **Cross-Reference Navigation**: In-modal navigation between related artefacts creates a seamless knowledge discovery experience that demonstrates the framework's linkage concept
6. **Framework-Aligned Tags**: Tags that map to Risk Taxonomy concepts (policy, governance, process-map, controls, feeds, methodologies, etc.) reinforce the framework integration
7. **Bookmark State Management**: Updating both grid and modal states ensures consistency
8. **Filter Expandability**: Collapsible filters keep the interface clean while providing powerful filtering across 11 components
9. **Relative Time Display**: Makes artefact currency immediately apparent to users
10. **Domain-Specific Example**: Using Credit Risk as the example domain shows how the framework would be populated for a real risk area, making the implementation tangible and relatable
