# Knowledge Layer Enhancement: Dual Context Pattern

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Enhancement Type**: Major - Architectural Pattern Addition
**Inspired By**: Risk Taxonomy Framework "Using the Framework in Practice"

---

## Overview

Enhanced the Knowledge Layer to incorporate the **Dual Context Pattern** from your Risk Taxonomy Framework, transforming it from a static reference system into a dynamic, cross-domain knowledge evolution framework.

---

## Key Insight from Risk Taxonomy Framework

Your "Using the Framework in Practice" section revealed that domains don't just maintain their own artefacts—they operate in **two contexts**:

### Context 1: Domain-Specific Artefacts
Each domain (Market Risk, Credit Risk, Change Agent) maintains its own complete set of artefacts across all 11 taxonomy levels.

### Context 2: Cross-Domain Modification
Change Agent (and other domains) also **modify other domain artefacts** through formal change projects using a check-out/check-in workflow.

**Critical Example You Provided**:
> "When Risk Change is making a change to a specific domain area e.g. Market Risk...the Taxonomy for that particular domain area is relevant too since any changes made would mean changes to the specific artefacts within the taxonomy for that domain area. For example if there was a change to on-board a new product, that might require an update to the Market Risk Policies, change to the procedures, the addition of some new metrics relevant to that product..."

This is the missing piece that transforms our Knowledge Layer from **static documentation** to **dynamic knowledge management**.

## What We Enhanced

### 1. Main Documentation Update

**File**: [docs/module-2-step-2.5-knowledge-layer.md](module-2-step-2.5-knowledge-layer.md)

**Enhanced Section**: "Adapting Risk Taxonomy Framework: The Dual Context Pattern"

**Added**:
- **Context 1**: Complete table showing all 11 taxonomy components adapted for Change Agent domain
- **Context 2**: Explained Change Agent as change modifier with concrete Market Risk product onboarding example
- **Check-Out/Check-In Workflow**: 5-step process (Check Out → Modify → Track → Validate → Check In)
- **Domain-Specific vs Shared Artefacts**: Clarified which artefacts are unique vs bank-wide
- **Implementation Phases**: MVP (Context 1) with foundation for Context 2 expansion

**Impact**: Developers now understand the Knowledge Layer isn't just reference material—it's an evolving system that tracks changes across domains.

### 2. Knowledge Evolution Framework Document

**File**: [backend/knowledge/change-agent/meta/knowledge-evolution.md](../backend/knowledge/change-agent/meta/knowledge-evolution.md)
**Size**: 14 KB (~6,000 words)

**Complete framework documentation including**:

#### The Dual Context Pattern Explained
- Context 1: Static domain knowledge (meeting types, action standards)
- Context 2: Dynamic cross-domain modifications (updating other domains)
- Usage, ownership, and evolution for each context

#### Check-Out/Check-In Workflow (4 Phases)
1. **Phase 1: Check-Out**
   - Identify affected artefacts
   - Create change context
   - Lock version
   - Record baseline
   - *Example*: Change project document template

2. **Phase 2: Modify**
   - Update draft artefacts
   - Track changes with change log
   - Link to change context
   - Domain expert review cycles
   - *Example*: Change log format

3. **Phase 3: Validate**
   - Completeness check
   - Consistency check across artefacts
   - Quality review by domain experts
   - Testing in test environment
   - Formal sign-off
   - *Example*: Validation checklist (7 items)

4. **Phase 4: Check-In**
   - Version update (semantic versioning)
   - Archive old version
   - Release to production
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Close change context
   - *Example*: Check-in record template

#### Cross-Domain Knowledge Linking
- **Reference Links**: Point to related knowledge (`[[domain/category/doc.md]]`)
- **Update Links**: Track when this document triggers updates to other domains
- **Dependency Links**: Identify prerequisites from other domains
- **Link Maintenance**: When and how to update links
- **Broken Link Detection**: Automated checks and weekly reports

#### Knowledge Versioning
- **Semantic Versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH scheme
- **Version Tracking**: Frontmatter with version history
- **Git Integration**: Branch/tag strategy for change projects

#### Federated Ownership Model
- **Central Framework**: Structure, standards, workflow defined centrally
- **Distributed Maintenance**: Domain teams own their content
- **Ownership Matrix**: Table showing who owns what and review frequency
- **Review Cycles**: Quarterly, annually, or ad-hoc based on domain

#### Architecture for Context 2 (Future)
- Current state vs future state comparison
- Technical requirements (3 new classes needed)
- `ChangeContextManager`, `LinkValidator`, `KnowledgeVersionControl`

#### Best Practices
- For domain teams (5 practices)
- For change projects (5 practices)
- For skills development (4 practices)

#### Monitoring and Metrics
- **Knowledge Health**: Completeness, consistency, currency, usage
- **Change Velocity**: Active changes, change impact, frequency

**Impact**: Provides complete operational guide for Context 2 implementation when we expand beyond MVP.

### 3. Cross-Domain Examples in All Knowledge Documents

Enhanced all three meeting-management knowledge documents with cross-domain context:

#### A. decision-capture.md Enhancement
**File**: [backend/knowledge/change-agent/meeting-management/decision-capture.md](../backend/knowledge/change-agent/meeting-management/decision-capture.md)
**Size**: 11 KB (was 7.8 KB) - **+41% content**

**New Section**: "Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration"

**Added**:
- **When Decisions Affect Other Domains**: Dual context explanation
- **Cross-Domain Decision Impact Examples** (3 scenarios):
  1. **Product Onboarding**: Decision affects 6 domain artefacts (Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operations, Compliance)
  2. **Policy Change**: Decision affects 3 domain artefacts (Change Agent, IT Systems, Compliance)
  3. **Resource Allocation**: Decision affects 3 domain artefacts (Finance, HR, Project Management)
- **Within Domain Links**: To other Change Agent knowledge
- **Cross-Domain Dependencies**: List of 4 hypothetical domain knowledge docs to consult

**Example Provided**:
```markdown
**Decision**: "Approved FX Options product for trading"

**Other Domains Affected**:
- [[market-risk/products/approved-products-list.md]] - Add FX Options
- [[market-risk/methodologies/risk-calculations.md]] - Add risk methodology
- [[market-risk/data/metrics-dictionary.md]] - Define new metrics
- [[credit-risk/policies/counterparty-limits.md]] - Set credit limits
- [[operations/systems/trading-platform-config.md]] - Configure systems
- [[compliance/reports/regulatory-reporting.md]] - Update reports
```

**Impact**: Users understand that decisions don't just get documented—they trigger formal change processes across multiple domains.

#### B. action-items-standards.md Enhancement
**File**: [backend/knowledge/change-agent/meeting-management/action-items-standards.md](../backend/knowledge/change-agent/meeting-management/action-items-standards.md)
**Size**: 10 KB (was 5.4 KB) - **+85% content**

**New Section**: "Cross-Domain Action Items"

**Added**:
- **Cross-Domain Action Item Examples** (3 detailed scenarios):
  1. **Product Onboarding Action**: Update Market Risk artefact, requires domain expertise
  2. **Policy Update Action**: Update Change Agent artefact, owned directly
  3. **Multi-Domain Implementation Action**: Requires coordination across 3 domains

- **Tracking Cross-Domain Actions**: 5-step process
  1. Identify affected artefacts
  2. Assign domain owners
  3. Link to change context
  4. Track dependencies
  5. Verify completion

- **Action Item with Cross-Domain Tracking**: Complete template showing:
  - Target artefact
  - Change project ID
  - Check-out requirement
  - Domain approval authority
  - Dependencies with owners and dates
  - 7-item verification checklist

**Example Provided**:
```markdown
**Task**: "Update Market Risk calculation methodology document to include FX Options delta and gamma calculations"

**Cross-Domain Details**:
- Target Artefact: [[market-risk/methodologies/risk-calculations.md]]
- Change Project: PROJ-FX-OPTIONS-2025
- Check-Out Required: Yes
- Domain Approval: Market Risk Director
- Dependencies:
  - Product spec finalized (owner: Bob, due: 2025-11-01)
  - Data feeds configured (owner: Charlie, due: 2025-11-05)
```

**Impact**: Action items now explicitly track which domain artefacts they affect, who owns them, and what the change workflow requires.

#### C. meeting-types.md Enhancement
**File**: [backend/knowledge/change-agent/meeting-management/meeting-types.md](../backend/knowledge/change-agent/meeting-management/meeting-types.md)
**Size**: 9.6 KB (was 4.0 KB) - **+140% content**

**New Section**: "Cross-Domain Meeting Context"

**Added**:
- **Meeting Type → Domain Impact Mapping**: Table showing which meeting types typically involve cross-domain work
  - Decision-Making: 1-3 other domains, policy updates
  - Planning: Project domain, resource allocations
  - Status Update: Single domain, minimal cross-domain
  - Problem-Solving: 2-3 domains, cross-functional fixes
  - Brainstorming: Single domain, minimal impact
  - Information Sharing: All domains, no updates (read-only)

- **Cross-Domain Meeting Examples** (3 detailed scenarios):
  1. **Product Approval Committee**: 6 domains present, 5 cross-domain artefact updates
  2. **Project Steering Committee**: 5 domains present, 4 cross-domain artefact updates
  3. **Risk Committee**: 5 domains present, 4 cross-domain artefact updates

- **Meeting Type Selection with Cross-Domain Awareness**: 4 decision factors
  1. How many domains involved?
  2. Are decisions affecting other domains?
  3. Who owns the artefacts being discussed?
  4. What's the change impact?

**Example Provided**:
```markdown
**Product Approval Committee**

Domains Present: Change Agent, Product Management, Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operations, Compliance

Cross-Domain Updates Required:
- [[product-management/products/approved-products-list.md]] - Add product
- [[market-risk/products/products-risk-characteristics.md]] - Add risk profile
- [[credit-risk/policies/counterparty-limits.md]] - Set credit limits
- [[operations/systems/trading-platform-config.md]] - Configure systems
- [[compliance/reports/regulatory-reporting.md]] - Update filing requirements

Change Agent Role: Captures decision and creates action items for each domain to update their artefacts via check-out/check-in workflow.
```

**Impact**: Meeting facilitators understand upfront which domains are affected and what knowledge evolution will be triggered.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. MVP Scope (Context 1 - Current)
- ✅ Static knowledge for Change Agent domain
- ✅ Cross-domain reference links documented
- ✅ Manual version tracking via frontmatter
- ✅ Conceptual framework for Context 2

### 2. Future Scope (Context 2 - Planned)
- ⏳ Automated check-out/check-in workflow
- ⏳ Cross-domain change impact analysis
- ⏳ Real-time link validation
- ⏳ Change project integration
- ⏳ Automated stakeholder notification

**Rationale**: MVP demonstrates the pattern with real examples. Context 2 requires integration with change management systems (JIRA, Git, workflow engines) which is beyond MVP scope but architecturally supported.

### 3. Cross-Domain Reference Format

**Decision**: Use `[[domain/category/document.md]]` format even for non-existent artefacts

**Rationale**:
- Standard markdown wiki-link syntax
- Self-documenting (path structure shows domain/category organization)
- Easy to parse programmatically for future link validation
- Clear distinction: Plain `[[file.md]]` = within domain, Monospace `` `[[...]]` `` = cross-domain

**Example**:
```markdown
## Links to Other Knowledge

### Within Change Agent Domain
- [[meeting-types.md]] - Same domain, plain markdown

### Cross-Domain Dependencies
- `[[market-risk/products/approved-products-list.md]]` - Other domain, monospace
```

### 4. Federated Ownership

**Decision**: Central framework, distributed content maintenance

**Rationale**: Directly from your Risk Taxonomy Framework principles
- Change Agent team defines structure and standards
- Domain teams own their artefacts' content
- Prevents bottlenecks (central team doesn't need to know all domain details)
- Scales to 100+ artefacts across multiple domains
