## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Framework Complexity
**Issue**: Some frameworks (5×5 matrix, MoSCoW, etc.) are complex to implement in text
**Solution**: Used ASCII art for matrices, clear tables for classifications

### Challenge 2: Example Completeness
**Issue**: Advanced skills need complete examples, not abbreviated ones
**Solution**: Included full 380-440 line examples in SKILL.md files

### Challenge 3: Multiple Frameworks
**Issue**: requirements-gathering uses 4 different frameworks
**Solution**: Structured output to seamlessly integrate all frameworks

### Challenge 4: Professional Depth
**Issue**: These skills need practitioner-level depth, not just demos
**Solution**: Used real-world scenarios (PostgreSQL migration, resource retention risk)

## Comparison: Core vs Advanced Skills

| Metric | Core Skills (6.2) | Advanced Skills (6.3) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Skills Count | 5 | 4 |
| Avg Lines/Skill | 265 | 372 (+40%) |
| Avg Implementation Time | 35 min | 38 min (+9%) |
| Frameworks/Skill | 1-2 | 2-4 |
| Example Length | Moderate | Complete |
| Complexity | Low-Medium | Medium-High to High |

**Insight**: Advanced skills are 40% larger and more complex but only took 9% longer to implement (template efficiency)

---

## Next Steps

With all 10 skills complete (Steps 6.1, 6.2, 6.3), we move to:
- **Step 6.4**: Integration & Testing
  - Verify skills load via SkillsLoader
  - Test skills through backend API
  - Connect frontend Skills Browser to real skills
  - End-to-end validation

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Framework-First Approach**: Starting with industry frameworks ensured professional quality
2. **Complete Examples**: Full examples made expected output crystal clear
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: Using actual project scenarios (database migration, resource risks) made skills immediately applicable
4. **Template Efficiency**: Even complex skills took only ~40 min due to template

### What Could Be Improved
- Could have created shared framework documentation (5×5 matrix, MoSCoW, etc.)
- Could have standardized severity levels across skills (P1-P4)
- Could have created more integration examples between skills

### Process Improvements
- Implementing frameworks consistently across skills
- Using real-world examples from actual projects
- Maintaining professional depth while keeping implementation time reasonable
