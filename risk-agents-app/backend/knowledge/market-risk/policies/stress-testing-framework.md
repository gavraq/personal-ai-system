# Market Risk Stress Testing Framework

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1
As part of the Market Risk Policy, all risk factors are subject to stress shocks under the Market Risk Stress Framework, to determine loss vulnerabilities in the trading portfolio under market stress moves. Stress testing is performed on a bi-weekly basis with functionality to run stress testing daily if required.

### 1.2
In addition to individual risk factor stress measures, the trading book of ICBC Standard Bank Plc ("ICBCS") and particular sub-portfolios thereof are subject to stress testing and scenario analysis, i.e. combinations of extreme moves across a range of risk factors.

The portfolio stress scenarios are a key market risk control that work in conjunction with the value-at-risk (VaR) measure to loss vulnerabilities on the trading book. Market Risk scenario stresses, unlike VaR which is a historical simulation calculation methodology, are blunt shocks applied to all risk factors in the trading portfolios.

### 1.3
Typically Stress scenario exposures differ from VaR exposures in that the shock parameters can be forward-looking (i.e. they are not confined to loss returns associated with past market events). Stress Scenarios deliberately target the "tail" aspect of the trading risk which is beyond the VaR frontier exposure loss of 99% confidence interval.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1
The bank's programme of stress testing includes all traded linear and non-linear products and considers the following:
- Concentration risk
- liquidity horizons on position exit across all asset classes in stressed market conditions
- One-way market behaviour
- Event and jump-to-default risks
- Asymmetry of Stress moves associated with deep out-of-the-money and onshore vs offshore positions
- Positions that are sensitive to the grouping of prices
- Other risks (if material) that may not be captured appropriately in the bank's value-at-risk model e.g. recovery rate uncertainty, implied correlations and certain volatility skew risks

The stress shocks applied to individual risk factors must reflect the nature of the underlying portfolios and the time it could take to hedge out or manage risk under severe market conditions. Historical scenarios are calibrated to a 10d liquidity horizon exit in line with the regulatory VaR and SVaR and ICAAP market risk concentration monthly risk assessments.

### 2.2
Market Risk is responsible on a quarterly basis to assess Net (outright risk), Curve (tenor impact) and Basis risk impact(i.e.g. Bond swap, Futures vs Physical, Onshore/Offshore currency spot rate risk) in the trading portfolio. Such positions should be incorporated into the relevant Stress scenario(s) or if no new positions are identified on a quarterly basis, then this should be attested to.

### 2.3
Market Risk is responsible for identifying market risk stress scenarios that highlight underlying risk factors to seek out vulnerabilities to the trading portfolio. Scenarios used must be appropriate to test the effect of adverse movements in market volatilities with considerations to correlated impacts across other key positions in competing asset classes, as well as the effect of any change in the assumptions underlying the bank's value-at-risk model. The results of the bank's Market risk stress testing and scenario analysis must be reviewed by management and is an intrinsic Level 1 limit that supports the bank's Risk Appetite Framework.

## 3. Types of Market Risk Stress

### 3.1 "Worst-Case" Stresses

#### 3.1.1
The "worst-case" base case stress loss attributable to the bank's trading book (Global Markets) is the greatest loss produced by each day's 1-day or 10-day VaR or SVaR formats. This measure, by definition, includes all severe market events and disruptions during the historical observation period.

#### 3.1.2
Market Risk consult in with Business to determine stress scenario parameters but ultimately the changes are at the discretion of Market risk to interpret these simulations for the purposes of monitoring the bank's stress loss estimations. This can include selection of the most appropriate window (stress or historic), holding period or portfolio aggregation level.

#### 3.1.3
Working of the VaR and the VaR methodology can be found in the Bank's VaR Methodology and Value at Risk policies.

### 3.2 Severe Historical Event Stresses

#### 3.2.1
Severe historical events are those outside the historical observation period that underlies the bank's VaR measures.

# Market Risk Stress Testing Procedures

### 3.3 Potential Stress Scenarios
The specific market moves associated with such an historical event may be directly applied to the bank's trading book or particular sub-portfolio thereof, but more often they are built into a potential stress scenario â€“ see section 3.3 below.

#### 3.3.1 Potential stress scenarios are developed by Market Risk and may be based on:
- Historical events, which may include events covered by the historical data series
- Events currently considered possible thematic issues point in time (e.g. Brexit, Covid-19, Russia/Ukraine crisis and Global inflation cycle and 2008 Global Financial Crisis.)

#### 3.3.2
Findings from the Market Risk monthly ICAAP Concentration risk assessments, fortnightly Risk vs trader FIC and commodity meetings and weekly point-of -weakness stresses. In selecting potential stress scenarios, Market Risk will take account of the major risks identified by the daily risk factor exposure and stress loss measures, issuer risk exposures and country risk exposures.

### 3.4 Point-of-Weakness Stress Scenarios

#### 3.4.1
In addition to the key market risk stress testing scenarios (Pillar Stresses), which are typically top-down in scenario assessment, Market Risk perform, analysis and reporting on a weekly frequency for specific loss scenarios associated with key trading strategies (bottom up stress approach) known as Point- of -weakness (PoW) stress. The PoW stresses:
- Identify the main vulnerabilities or top risks in the trading portfolio which are most sensitive to price (implied volatility, correlation, spread, basis or any other market related information) changes weighted by their P&L impact (bottom-up approach)
- Define a set of extreme, but plausible, market price changes for the identified key trading strategies.

## 4 Stress Testing

### 4.1 Frequency & Level of Stress Testing

#### 4.1.1
Stress testing is performed on a bi-weekly basis for all traded positions residing under the Management VaR population reporting

#### 4.1.2
Market Risk is responsible for ensuring that the stress testing results above are reported to the bank's regulator in accordance with section 4.3

#### 4.1.3
Market Risk is responsible for ensuring that stress testing results cover the entire trading book are reported to senior risk and trading management and ExCo in accordance with section 4.4

### 4.2 Conduct of Stress Testing

#### 4.2.1
Market Risk is responsible for market risk stress testing.

### 4.3 Reporting of Stress Testing Results to Regulators
