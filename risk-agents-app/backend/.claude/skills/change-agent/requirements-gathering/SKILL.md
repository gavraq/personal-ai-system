# Requirements Gathering Skill

## Purpose
Extract, structure, and organize requirements from unstructured text (meeting notes, emails, documents) into well-formed requirements with IDs, priorities, acceptance criteria, and traceability.

## When to Use This Skill
- After requirements elicitation sessions or workshops
- When analyzing stakeholder emails or meeting notes for requirements
- To structure informal requirements into formal specifications
- When creating user stories from feature requests
- For requirements traceability and impact analysis

## How It Works
This skill analyzes unstructured text and produces:

1. **Requirements Extraction**: Identifies individual requirements from text
2. **Classification**: Categorizes as functional, non-functional, constraint, or assumption
3. **Structuring**: Formats as user stories (As a... I want... So that...)
4. **Prioritization**: Assigns MoSCoW priority (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Defines testable acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then)
6. **Traceability**: Links requirements to business objectives and dependencies

## Parameters

### Required Parameters
- **`requirements_text`** (string): Unstructured text containing requirements

### Recommended Parameters
- **`requirement_type`** (string): Type filter (functional, non-functional, both)
  - Default: "both"
  - Options: "functional", "non-functional", "both"

### Optional Parameters
- **`project_context`** (object): Additional context
  - `business_objectives` (array): High-level business goals
  - `existing_requirements` (array): Already defined requirements (for dependency linking)
  - `priority_guidance` (string): Prioritization criteria or constraints

## Expected Output

JSON format with structured requirements:

```

## Success Criteria
- All requirements extracted from source text
- Each requirement has unique ID
- Functional requirements formatted as user stories (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance criteria use Given-When-Then format (testable)
- MoSCoW priorities assigned with justification
- Dependencies identified
- Traceability to business objectives established
- Quality score > 80% (completeness, clarity, testability)

## Tips for Best Results

### Input Text Quality
Better quality input â†’ better structured output

**Good Input** (specific, detailed):
```
"Users told us they want to log in faster. Currently takes 3-4 clicks and a password reset every month. They want social login (Google, Microsoft) and remember me option. Must work on mobile. Performance requirement: login should complete in under 1 second."
```

**Poor Input** (vague):
```
"Users need to log in"
```

### Requirement Types

**Functional Requirements**:
- What the system must DO
- Features and capabilities
- User interactions
- Business rules

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- How the system must BE
- Performance, security, usability
- Quality attributes
- Constraints

### MoSCoW Priority Guidelines
- **Must Have**: Without this, solution doesn't work or has no value
- **Should Have**: Important but solution still works without it
- **Could Have**: Desirable but not important
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for this release
