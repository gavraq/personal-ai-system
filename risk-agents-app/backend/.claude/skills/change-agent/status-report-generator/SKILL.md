# Status Report Generator Skill

## Purpose
Generate professional, executive-level status reports with RAG (Red/Amber/Green) indicators, key metrics, accomplishments, risks, issues, and next steps for stakeholder communication.

## When to Use This Skill
- Weekly/bi-weekly project status updates
- Monthly executive summaries
- Board or steering committee reporting
- Stakeholder communication and transparency
- Project health dashboards

## How It Works
This skill transforms project data into an executive-friendly status report with:

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level project health and key messages (3-4 sentences)
2. **RAG Status**: Red/Amber/Green indicators for scope, schedule, budget, quality
3. **Key Metrics**: Quantitative progress indicators with trend arrows
4. **Accomplishments**: What was delivered this period (wins and achievements)
5. **Risks & Issues**: Active concerns with severity and mitigation
6. **Next Steps**: Upcoming milestones and focus areas
7. **Decisions Needed**: Items requiring executive input or approval

## Parameters

### Required Parameters
- **`project_data`** (object): Project information including:
  - `project_name` (string): Name of the project
  - `status` (object): Current status across dimensions
  - `accomplishments` (array): Recent achievements
  - `metrics` (object): Key performance indicators

### Recommended Parameters
- **`reporting_period`** (object): Time period for this report
  - `start_date` (date): Period start

# Project Status Report: Customer Portal Redesign

**Report Date**: October 26, 2025
**Reporting Period**: October 13 - October 26, 2025 (Week 3-4)
**Project Manager**: Sarah Johnson
**Executive Sponsor**: John Smith

---

## Executive Summary

The Customer Portal Redesign project is progressing well with **design phase 95% complete** and development starting on schedule. We achieved a major milestone this period with **stakeholder approval of final designs**. However, timeline is at risk (AMBER) due to a 3-day delay in CRM integration API documentation. Budget and scope remain on track (GREEN). Key decision needed: approve $5K additional budget for expedited user testing.

## Risks & Issues

### Active High Risks (Requires Attention)

**RISK-001: CRM API Documentation Delay** üî¥ **HIGH**

## Success Criteria
- Executive summary provides complete picture in 3-4 sentences
- RAG status is honest and accurate (no sugarcoating or hiding issues)
- Metrics show trends (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üí) not just current numbers
- Accomplishments are specific and measurable
- Risks have mitigation plans, not just descriptions
- Decisions needed are actionable with clear ask
- Report can be read in 5-10 minutes

## Tips for Best Results

### Input Data Quality
- Provide specific metrics with numbers (not vague "progressing well")
- Include both current and target values for metrics
- List actual accomplishments (deliverables completed, not activities done)
- Identify real risks with probability and impact
- Be specific about what decisions are needed

### RAG Status Guidelines
- **üü¢ GREEN**: On track, confidence > 80%, no concerns
- **üü° AMBER**: At risk, confidence 50-80%, mitigation plan exists
- **üî¥ RED**: Off track, confidence < 50%, immediate action required
