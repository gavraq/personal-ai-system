## Template Usage Guidelines

### When to use each section:

- **Attendees**: Always required
- **Meeting Objectives**: Required for structured meetings

- **Parking Lot**: Optional, use for deferred topics
- **Next Steps**: Always recommended

### Tips for effective minutes:

1. **Be concise**: Capture key points, not verbatim transcripts
2. **Be objective**: Record facts and decisions, not opinions
3. **Be specific**: Use concrete details and dates
4. **Be actionable**: Ensure action items are clear and assignable
5. **Be timely**: Distribute within 24 hours of meeting

### Formatting conventions:

- Use bold for emphasis on key terms
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use tables for action items and tracking
- Use checkboxes [ ] for next steps
- Use clear section headers
- Include dates in YYYY-MM-DD format for clarity
