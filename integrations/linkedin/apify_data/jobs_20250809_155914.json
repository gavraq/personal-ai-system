While research shows that classroom teachers are the single most important in-school factor in improving student achievement, their diverse voices are consistently left out of education policy decisions. For far too long, teachers have been treated as subjects of change rather than as agents of change.Founded by public school teachers, Educators for Excellence is a growing movement of 35,000 educators, united around a common set of values and principles for improving student learning and elevating the teaching profession. We work together to identify issues that impact our schools, create solutions to these challenges, and advocate for policies and programs that give all students access to a quality education.What We DoOur Theory of Change is grounded in two long-term goals that are inextricably linked: better outcomes for our students and the elevation of the quality and prestige of the teaching profession. We achieve these goals by changing policy at the district, state, and federal levels and transforming our teachers\u2019 union to be more student-focused, democratic, diverse, and anti-racist.

Through E4E, tens of thousands of educators have signed on to a common vision for elevating the teaching profession and improving student outcomes; thousands of teacher members have successfully advocated for and won equity and excellence focused policy changes in their local communities; and hundreds have trained for and taken on positions of elected and appointed leadership in their schools, districts, and unions.With chapters in New York, California, Connecticut, Chicago, Massachusetts, and Minnesota, our organizing culture is grounded in our passion for impacting educational systems and revolves around an innovative, roll-up-your-sleeves spirit backed by a shared commitment to continuous professional growth.Reporting directly to the National Director of Policy and Strategic Initiatives, Lead, the Policy Associate will be a part of E4E\u2019s Program Team and will increase our capacity to advance the organization\u2019s policy priorities, identify opportunities to connect and collaborate with external partners, support issue-based advocacy campaigns through policy and data analysis, and serve as a project manager for critical pieces of team initiatives on our MA, CA, and CT teams.
