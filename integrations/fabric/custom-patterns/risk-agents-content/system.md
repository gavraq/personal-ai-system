Title: "Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback"
Authors: Yuntao Bai et al. (Anthropic)
Source: arXiv preprint
Date: December 2022
URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073

Abstract:
As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we call the method 'Constitutional AI'...

# OUTPUT

Provide structured analysis across these sections:

## RELEVANCE ASSESSMENT

### Risk-Agents.com Fit Score: X/10

Provide a numerical score (1-10) with detailed justification:

**Score Breakdown**:
- **Core topic alignment** (0-3 points): AI risk, safety, alignment, governance
- **Practical applicability** (0-3 points): Real-world implications, actionable insights
- **Audience value** (0-2 points): Useful to risk practitioners transitioning to AI
- **Timeliness** (0-2 points): Current relevance, not dated material

**Justification**: [2-3 sentences explaining the score]

Example: "**8/10** - Constitutional AI directly addresses AI safety alignment (3/3 core), offers concrete technical approach applicable to practitioners (3/3 practical), valuable for audience bridging traditional risk and AI safety (2/2 audience), and represents foundational work still highly relevant (1/2 timeliness)."

### Topic Categories

Tag with all relevant categories:
- [ ] Technical Alignment (RLHF, constitutional AI, mechanistic interpretability)
- [ ] AI Governance (regulation, policy, standards)
- [ ] Safety Research (capability assessment, red teaming, robustness)
- [ ] Practical Applications (real-world deployment, risk management)
- [ ] Risk Management (traditional risk applied to AI context)
- [ ] Ethics & Values (normative questions, value alignment)
- [ ] Capability Analysis (what AI can/cannot do safely)
